# How to Download and Prepare "Blastronaut" Game Files

Blastronaut is an indie game available on itch.io. This tutorial will guide you through downloading the game file, renaming it, and moving it to the appropriate folder.

## Step 1: Download the Game File

1. Visit the Blastronaut game page on itch.io: [Blastronaut](https://perfoon.itch.io/blastronaut).
2. Locate the download section on the page.
3. Click on the download link (Linux or MacOS) to start downloading the game file. Ensure you download the `.pck` file.

## Step 2: Rename the Game File

1. Once the download is complete, navigate to the folder where the file is saved.
2. Find the downloaded `.pck` file. It might be named something like `blastronaut_vX.XX.pck`.
3. Right-click on the file and select "Rename" (or simply click on the filename once to select it and then press `F2` on your keyboard).
4. Rename the file to `game.pck`. Make sure to keep the `.pck` extension unchanged.

## Step 3: Move the File to the Game Data Folder

1. Locate the folder where you have the game installed or where you plan to install it.
2. Inside this folder, find or create a subfolder named `gamedata` (if it doesn't already exist).
3. Move the `game.pck` file into the `gamedata` folder. You can do this by dragging and dropping the file into the folder.

## Step 4: Launch the Game

1. After moving the file, you can now launch Blastronaut.
2. The game should recognize the `game.pck` file in the `gamedata` folder and load the necessary resources.

Congratulations! You've successfully downloaded and prepared Blastronaut for gameplay.
