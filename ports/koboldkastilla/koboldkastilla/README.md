# Kobold Kastilla

Inspired by La-Mulana, L'Abbaye des Morts and ZX Spectrum games in general, you'll be exploring and learning the history of an abandoned observatory while collecting items to further your progress and solving some puzzles. Not nearly as cryptic as La-Mulana but keeping a notepad or screenshot tool at the ready is recommended.

## Game Overview

**Gameplay:**
- Features 43 screens to explore and the odd sense of humor that you'd expect from a Spectrum game. Around 40-90 minutes long blind, and as little as 15 once mastered!
