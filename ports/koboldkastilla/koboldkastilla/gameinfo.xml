    <desc>Inspired by La-Mulana, L'Abbaye des Morts and ZX Spectrum games in general, you'll be exploring and learning the history of an abandoned observatory while collecting items to further your progress and solving some puzzles. Not nearly as cryptic as La-Mulana but keeping a notepad or screenshot tool at the ready is recommended.</desc>
